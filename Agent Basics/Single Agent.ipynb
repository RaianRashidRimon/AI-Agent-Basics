This block contains the explicit command `print(google_search.search(queries=[...]))`. This is the system's way of showing you *exactly* what search queries I'm formulating and sending to Google. If I weren't performing a search, this block would not appear or would be empty.\n",

      "2.  **Citations Referencing Search Results:** For any piece of information I present that comes from a Google search, I will include citations in the format `[cite:INDEX]`. These indices directly link back to the specific snippets of text from the search results that I used to construct my answer. If I were simply recalling information from my training data, these citations would not be present for factual claims.\n",

      "3.  **Timeliness and Specificity:** If you ask about very recent events, current statistics, or highly specific details that are unlikely to be deeply embedded in my core training data (which has a knowledge cut-off), and I provide an accurate answer with citations, it's a clear sign I've performed a live search.\n",
      "\n",
      "Think of the `tool_code` block as me showing you my \"scratchpad\" where I write down the questions I need to ask the \"real world\" (via Google Search). The citations are my footnotes, pointing to the exact source where I found the answer.\n",
